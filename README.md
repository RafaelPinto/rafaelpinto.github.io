# Rafael Pinto

I use Python to extract data from various sources, clean it, and deliver it ready for further analysis. I’ve
pulled data from file systems with crawlers, from SQL and MongoDB, and the web. I check data integrity
with Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborne. I’m passionate about documenting and TDD.

## SKILLS
**Python**: Pathlib, CSV, Itertools, Collections. **Data**: NumPy, Pandas. Viz: Matplotlib, Seaborn, PyViz,
ipywidgets. **Deploy**: Voila, Heroku. Databases: SQLite, Postgres, MongoDB. **Testing**: Pytest, Unittest.

## EXPERIENCE
### Noble Energy, Houston, TX / Unconventional Technology Geo
APRIL 2019 – PRESENT
I build applications to solve problems in the exploration and development of unconventional resources. I
created a data wrangling program to sort, validate, and output a selection of well logs from a collection
of 250k LAS files. I implemented a CLI to interact with the sorting process. I stored the data in MongoDB.

As POC, I created an open-source [polling application](http://destination-polling.herokuapp.com/) to understand the requirement for deployment
using Jupyter Notebook, Voila, and Heroku. I stored the results in a Postgres database.

Presently, I'm building a stage classification tool based on the stage completion treatment data. I’ve
created a file system crawler to find and sort files that follow a given template. From the millions of files
processed, only 5k were a match. I produced visualization tools using Plotly to facilitate user access to
the data. I’m applying regression analysis to extract the pressure decline curve features as input to ML.

### Noble Energy, Houston, TX / Geophysicist
JUNE 2011 – APRIL 2019
I interpreted seismic data and performed quantitative analysis via seismic geostatistical inversion and
rock physics. I predicted formation wells tops with less than 3 meters of error at 3 km of depth, correctly
guessing reservoir thickness and fluid type. I doubled a field's booked reserve estimations. I built a self-
consistent subsalt geologic model from multidisciplinary and disparate data. Whenever possible, I
automated processes with Python, e.g., computing probability maps from hundreds of map realizations.
